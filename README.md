# RawTextureData Processing Examples
Documentation gives little helpful information on this topic so I created this repo to document how to create matching data structure + how to read & process it in a IJobParallelFor.

This repository contains 2 example job types:
- Invert image color
- Simple(st) image edge detection
Tester window available under MenuItem "Test/Raw Texture Data/Processing Example"

NOTE: You can process NativeArray in some different type of job or even completely outside any. It's simply fastest this way.
